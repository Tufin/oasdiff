## Demo

## The main commands
- [diff](DIFF.md): the diff between OpenAPI specs, fully detailed
- [breaking](BREAKING-CHANGES.md): breaking changes between OpenAPI specs  
- [changelog](BREAKING-CHANGES.md): important changes between OpenAPI specs including breaking and non-breaking changes
- [flatten](ALLOF.md): replace all instances of allOf by a merged equivalent
- checks: displays the different checks that oasdiff runs to detect changes

## Roadmap
I am currently working on the ability to correlate breaking changes and changelog messages with the underlying changes in the original YAML spec.  
This will allow users to see changes in their original context, investigate, and determine how to handle them.  
Specifically, github users will be able to click annotations and see the diff at the relevant line as discussed [here](https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff/issues/574).  
[Please help us prioritize the roadmap](https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff/discussions/631).

## Credits
This project relies on the excellent implementation of OpenAPI 3.0 for Go: [kin-openapi](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi).

## Feedback
We welcome your feedback.
