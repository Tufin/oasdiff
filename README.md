## Usage Examples

### YAML diff of local files
```bash
oasdiff -base data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision data/openapi-test2.yaml
```
The default output format is YAML.  
No output means that the diff is empty, or, in other words, there are no changes.

### Text/Markdown diff of local files
```bash
oasdiff -format text -base data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision data/openapi-test2.yaml
```
The Text/Markdown diff report provides a simplified and partial view of the changes.  
To view all details, use the default format: YAML.  
If you'd like to see additional details in the text/markdown report, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### HTML diff of local files
```bash
oasdiff -format html -base data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision data/openapi-test2.yaml
```
The HTML diff report provides a simplified and partial view of the changes.  
To view all details, use the default format: YAML.  
If you'd like to see additional details in the HTML report, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).


### Diff files over http/s
```bash
oasdiff -format text -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Check for breaking changes (new method)
```bash
oasdiff -check-breaking -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Check for breaking changes across multiple specs (new method)
```bash
oasdiff -check-breaking -composed -base "data/composed/base/*.yaml" -revision "data/composed/revision/*.yaml"
```

### Fail with exit code 1 if a breaking change is found (new method)
```bash
oasdiff -fail-on-diff -check-breaking -composed -base "data/composed/base/*.yaml" -revision "data/composed/revision/*.yaml"
```

### Check for any changes across multiple specs
```bash
oasdiff -composed -base "data/composed/base/*.yaml" -revision "data/composed/revision/*.yaml"
```

### Fail with exit code 1 if any change is found
```bash
oasdiff -fail-on-diff -format text -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Display changes to endpoints containing "/api" in the path
```bash
oasdiff -format text -filter "/api" -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```
Filters are applied recursively at all levels. For example, if a path contains a [callback](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/callbacks/), the filter will be applied both to the path itself and to the callback path. To include such a nested change, use a regular expression that contains both paths, for example ```-filter "path|callback-path"```

### Exclude paths and operations with extension "x-beta"
```bash
oasdiff -format text -filter-extension "x-beta" -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
``` 
Notes:
1. [OpenAPI Extensions](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/) can be defined both at the [path](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/) level and at the [operation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/) level. Both are matched and excluded with this flag.
2. If a path or operation has a matching extension only in one of the specs, but not in the other, it will appear as Added or Deleted.

### Ignore changes to description and examples
```bash
oasdiff -exclude-elements description,examples -format text -base data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision data/openapi-test3.yaml
``` 

### Display change summary
```bash
oasdiff -summary -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Running with Docker
To run with docker just replace the `oasdiff` command by `docker run --rm -t tufin/oasdiff`, for example:

```bash
docker run --rm -t tufin/oasdiff -format text -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Breaking changes with Docker
```bash
docker run --rm -t tufin/oasdiff -check-breaking -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

### Comparing local files with Docker
```bash
docker run --rm -t -v $(pwd)/data:/data:ro tufin/oasdiff -base /data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision /data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

Replace `$(pwd)/data` by the path that contains your files.  
Note that the `-base` and `-revision` paths must begin with `/`.  

## Diff and Breaking-Changes as a Service
You can use oasdiff as a service like this:
```
curl -X POST -F base=@openapi-test1.yaml -F revision=@openapi-test3.yaml https://api.oasdiff.com/diff
```
Or, to see breaking changes:
```
curl -X POST -F base=@openapi-test1.yaml -F revision=@openapi-test3.yaml https://api.oasdiff.com/breaking-changes
```
To compare specs over http/s, download them locally first:
```
curl -o openapi-test1.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml
curl -o openapi-test3.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```
Service source code: https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff-service

## Output Formats
The default output format, YAML, provides a full view of all diff details.  
Note that no output in the YAML format signifies that the diff is empty, or, in other words, there are no changes.  
Other formats: text, markdown, and HTML, are designed to be more user-friendly by providing only the most important parts of the diff, in a simplified format.  
The JSON format works only with `-exclude-elements endpoints` and is intended as a workaround for YAML complex mapping keys which aren't supported by some libraries (see comment at end of next section for more details).
If you wish to include additional details in non-YAML formats, please open an issue.

## Paths vs. Endpoints
OpenAPI Specification has a hierarchical model of [Paths](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object) and [Operations](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) (HTTP methods).  
oasdiff respects this hierarchy and displays a hierarchical diff with path changes: added, deleted and modified, and within the latter, "modified" section, another set of operation changes: added, deleted and modified. For example:
```yaml
paths:
    deleted:
        - /register
        - /subscribe
    modified:
        /api/{domain}/{project}/badges/security-score:
            operations:
                modified:
                    GET:
```
oasdiff also outputs an alternate simplified diff per "endpoint" which is a combination of Path + Operation, for example:
```yaml
endpoints:
    deleted:
        - method: POST
          path: /subscribe
        - method: POST
          path: /register
    modified:
        ?   method: GET
            path: /api/{domain}/{project}/badges/security-score
        :   tags:
                deleted:
                    - security
```
The modified endpoints section has two items per key, method and path, this is called a [complex mapping key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33987316/what-is-a-complex-mapping-key-in-yaml) in YAML.  
Some YAML libraries don't support complex mapping keys:
- python PyYAML: see https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff/issues/94#issuecomment-1087468450
- golang gopkg.in/yaml.v3 fails to unmarshal the oasdiff output. This package offers a solution: https://github.com/tliron/yamlkeys

In such cases, consider using `-exclude-elements endpoints` and `-format json` as a workaround.

## Breaking Changes
Breaking changes are changes that could break a client that is relying on the OpenAPI specification.  
[See some examples of breaking and non-breaking changes](breaking-changes.md).  
Notes: 
1. This is a Beta feature, please report issues
2. There are two different methods for detecting breaking changes (see below)


### Old Method
The original implementation with the `-breaking-only` flag.
While this method is still supported, the new one will eventually replace it.

### New Method
An improved implementation for detecting breaking changes with the `-check-breaking` flag.
This method works differently from the old one: it is more accurate, generates nicer human-readable output, and is easier to maintain and extend.

To use it, run oasdiff with the `-check-breaking` flag, e.g.:
```
oasdiff -check-breaking -base https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tufin/oasdiff/main/data/openapi-test3.yaml
```

There are two levels of breaking changes:
- `WARN` - Warning are potential breaking changes which developers should be aware of, but cannot be confirmed programmatically
- `ERR` - Errors are definite breaking changes which should be avoided

To exit with return code 1 when any ERR-level breaking changes are found, add the `-fail-on-diff` flag.  
To exit with return code 1 even if only WARN-level breaking changes are found, add the `-fail-on-diff` and `-fail-on-warns` flags.


### Stability Level
When a new API is introduced, you may want to allow developers to change its behavior without triggering a breaking-change error.  
The new Breaking Changes method provides this feature through the `x-stability-level` extension.  
There are four stability levels: `draft`->`alpha`->`beta`->`stable`.  
APIs with the levels `draft` or `alpha` can be changed freely without triggering a breaking-change error.  
Stability level may be increased, but not decreased, like this: `draft`->`alpha`->`beta`->`stable`.  
APIs with no stability level will trigger breaking changes errors upon relevant change.  
APIs with no stability level can be changed to any stability level.  

Example:
   ```
   /api/test:
    post:
     x-stability-level: "alpha"
   ```

### Ignoring Specific Breaking Changes
Sometimes, you may want to ignore certain breaking changes.  
The new Breaking Changes method allows you define breaking changes that you want to ignore in a configuration file.  
You can specify the configuration file name in the oasdiff command-line with the `-warn-ignore` flag for WARNINGS or the `-err-ignore` flag for ERRORS.  
Each line in the configuration file should contain two parts:
1. method and path
2. description of the breaking change

For example:
```
GET /api/{domain}/{project}/badges/security-score removed the success response with the status '200'
```

The line may contain additional info, like this:
```
 - 12.01.2023 In the GET /api/{domain}/{project}/badges/security-score, we removed the success response with the status '200'
```

The configuration files can be of any text type, e.g., Markdown, so you can use them to document breaking changes and other important changes.

### Breaking Changes to Enum Values
The new Breaking Changes method support rules for enum changes using the `x-extensible-enum` extension.  
This method allows adding new entries to enums used in responses which is very usable in many cases but requires clients to support a fallback to default logic when they receive an unknown value.
`x-extensible-enum` was introduced by [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#112) and picked up by the OpenAPI community. Technically, it could be replaced with anyOf+classical enum but the `x-extensible-enum` is a more explicit way to do it.  
In most cases the `x-extensible-enum` is similar to enum values, except it allows adding new entries in messages sent to the client (responses or callbacks).
If you don't use the `x-extensible-enum` in your OpenAPI specifications, nothing changes for you, but if you do, oasdiff will identify breaking changes related to `x-extensible-enum` parameters and properties.

### Optional Breaking-Changes Checks
You can use the `-include-checks` flag to include the following optional checks:
- response-non-success-status-removed
- api-operation-id-removed
- api-tag-removed
- response-property-enum-value-removed
- response-mediatype-enum-value-removed
- request-body-enum-value-removed

For example:
```
oasdiff -include-checks response-non-success-status-removed -check-breaking -base data/openapi-test1.yaml -revision data/openapi-test3.yaml
```


### Advantages of the New Breaking Changes Method 
- output is human readable
- supports localization for error messages and ignored changes
- [checks can be customized by developers](#customizing-breaking-changes-checks)
- fewer false-positive errors by design
- improved support for type changes: allows changing integer->number for json/xml properties, allows changing parameters (e.g. query/header/path) to type string from number/integer/etc.
- allows removal of responses with non-success codes (e.g., 503, 504, 403)
- allows adding new content-type to request
- easier to extend and customize
- will continue to be improved

### Limitations of the New Breaking Changes Method
- no checks for `context` instead of `schema` for request parameters
- no checks for `callback`s
- false-positive breaking change error when the path parameter renamed both in path and in parameters section to the same name, this can be mitigated with the checks errors ignore feature

## Composed Mode
Composed mode compares two collections of OpenAPI specs instead of a pair of specs in the default mode.
The collections are specified using a [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).
This can be useful when your APIs are defined across multiple files, for example, when multiple services, each one with its own spec, are exposed behind an API gateway, and you want to check changes across all the specs at once.

This mode is a little different from a regular comparison of two specs to each-other:
- compares only [paths and endpoints](#paths-vs-endpoints), other resources are compared only if referenced from the paths or endpoints
- compares each path/endpoint in 'base' to its equivalent in 'revision'
- if any endpoint appears more than once in 'base' or 'revision', then we use the endpoint with the most recent `x-since-date` value
- the `x-since-date` extension should be set on Path or Operation level
- `x-since-date` extensions set on the Operation level override the value set on Path level
- if an endpoint doesn't have `the x-since-date` extension, its value is set to the default: "2000-01-01"
- duplicate endpoints with the same x-since-date value will trigger an error
- the format of the `x-since-date` is the RFC3339 full-date format

Example of the `x-since-date` usage:
   ```
   /api/test:
    get:
     x-since-date: "2023-01-11"
   ```

Note: Composed mode doesn't support [Path Prefix Modification](#path-prefix-modification) 

## Non-Breaking Removal of Deprecated Resources
Sometimes APIs need to be removed, for example, when we replace an old API by a new version.
As API owners, we want a process that will allow us to phase out the old API version and transition to the new one smoothly as possible and with minimal disruptions to business.

OpenAPI specification supports a ```deprecated``` flag which can be used to mark operations and other object types as deprecated.  
Normally, deprecation **is not** considered a breaking change since it doesn't break the client but only serves as an indication of an intent to remove something in the future, in contrast, the eventual removal of a resource **is** considered a breaking change.

oasdiff allows you to gracefully remove a resource without getting the ```breaking-change``` warning, as follows:
1. First, the resource is marked as ```deprecated``` and a [special extension](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions) ```x-sunset``` is added to announce the date at which the resource will be removed
   ```
   /api/test:
    get:
     deprecated: true
     x-sunset: "2022-08-10"
   ```
2. At the sunset date or anytime later, the resource can be removed without triggering a ```breaking-change``` warning. An earlier removal will be considered a breaking change.

In addition, oasdiff also allows you to control the minimal number of days required between deprecating a resource and removing it with the ```deprecation-days``` flag.  
For example, the following command requires any deprecation to be accompanied by an ```x-sunset``` extension with a date which is at least 30 days away, otherwise the deprecation itself will be considered a breaking change:
```
oasdiff -deprecation-days=30 -breaking-only -base data/deprecation/base.yaml -revision data/deprecation/deprecated-past.yaml
```

Setting deprecation-days to 0 is equivalent to the default which allows non-breaking deprecation regardless of the sunset date.  
Note: this is a Beta feature. Please report issues.

## Path Prefix Modification
Sometimes paths prefixes need to be modified, for example, to create a new version:
- /api/v1/...
- /api/v2/...

oasdiff allows comparison of API specifications with modified prefixes by stripping and/or prepending path prefixes.  
In the example above you could compare the files as follows:
```
oasdiff -base original.yaml -revision new.yaml -strip-prefix-base /api/v1 -prefix-base /api/v2
```
or
```
oasdiff -base original.yaml -revision new.yaml -strip-prefix-base /api/v1 -strip-prefix-revision /api/v2
```
Note that stripping precedes prepending.

## Excluding Specific Kinds of Changes 
You can use the `-exclude-elements` flag to exclude certain kinds of changes:
- Use `-exclude-elements changes` to exclude [Examples](https://swagger.io/specification/#example-object)
- Use `-exclude-elements description` to exclude description fields
- Use `-exclude-elements title` to exclude title fields
- Use `-exclude-elements summary` to exclude summary fields
- Use `-exclude-elements endpoints` to exclude the [endpoints diff](#paths-vs-endpoints)

You can ignore multiple elements with a comma-separated list of excluded elements as in [this example](#ignore-changes-to-description-and-examples).  
Note that [Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions) are always excluded from the diff.


## Notes for Go Developers
### Embedding oasdiff into your program
```go
diff.Get(&diff.Config{}, spec1, spec2)
```

### Code Examples
- [diff](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tufin/oasdiff/diff#example-Get)
- [breaking changes](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tufin/oasdiff/diff#example-GetPathsDiff)
- [oasdiff command-line](main.go)

### Customizing Breaking-Changes Checks
If you encounter a change that isn't considered breaking by oasdiff and you would like to consider it as a breaking-change you may add an [optional breaking-changes check](#optional-breaking-changes-checks).  
Here's an example of adding a custom check: https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff/pull/208/files


### OpenAPI References
oasdiff expects [OpenAPI References](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/) to be resolved.  
References are normally resolved automatically when you load the spec. In other cases you can resolve refs using [Loader.ResolveRefsIn](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3#Loader.ResolveRefsIn).

## Requests for enhancements
1. OpenAPI 3.1 support: see https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff/issues/52
